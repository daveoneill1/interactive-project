# News Data Insight 

## Introduction 

### GDELT is an open source project that monitors and catalogues online news across the world.  I have been reading up on GDELT for about 6 months and find it fascinating. My longer term goal is to become proficient using Google Big Query and analysing the GDELT databases to generate meaningful insights from online news. With this longer term goal in mind I wanted to create the News Data Insight website as a first step, to learn and to showcase some of what's possible with GDELT. 

## User Experience 

### This website is designed for users interested in online news analysis. It is designed to be informative and give the user a flavour the type of insight GDELT can deliver. The plan is to regularly add articles about news data analysis. 

## User Types and Journey's

###  **Business or Academic Users**

* This user is interested in learning what type of insight news data analysis using GDELT could deliver. Our first interactice graph highlights the sentiment tone for three politicians over a 90 day period. PR companies use different types of analysis to test the reaction to news content. The overall tone of individual news outlets towards topics, people and organisations can also be measured.
